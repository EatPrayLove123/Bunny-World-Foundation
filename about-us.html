           <h2>BWF Mission and History</h2>
           <p>BWF Mission & History: Bunny World Foundation (BWF) is an ALL-Volunteer, non-profit 501(c) 3 animal welfare organization founded in 2008 in Los Angeles, California. Set up to promote (Shelter) Equity and Equality for Rabbits, BWF’s mission is to combat animal cruelty, illegal animal sales, exploitation and neglect of all animals, through rescue efforts, public education, investigations, legislation, special events, and media attention.</p>
           <p>BWF is proud to celebrate a TEN-year voyage which begun with the fierce struggle to bring to light illegal animal sales in the LA Fashion District.  In terms of global outreach, BWF grew to be the largest Rabbit Rescue & Educational Service in the world. With almost 300K fans on Facebook, BWF’s posts are shared by millions of bunny lovers worldwide.   </p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item3">
           <p>BWF works to reduce rabbit overpopulation and to establish rabbits as companion animals that deserve the same individual rights, level of care, and opportunity for longevity as cats and dogs that live as human companions.   BWF manages a complex Foster & Adoption Program that requires constant strengthening and expansion to accommodate new rescues and provide for their intensive care, medication, supplies, and spay/neuter funds. BWF has 300 volunteers/fosters and rescues over 700 abandoned and abused domestic rabbits a year.  In 2014, BWF was featured by CBS as one of the "Five Best Volunteer Opportunities for Animal Lovers in Los Angeles.” </p>
           <p>BWF rescued over 9,000 rabbits in the City of LA, ranging from un-weaned baby bunnies from Santee Alley to adult bunnies from the over-inundated city shelters.  In the past year alone (2017), BWF took in over 500 “Red” and “Blue” rabbits from the SIX City Shelters.  In addition, BWF housed, provided medical care, promoted, and found permanent and loving homes for more than 700 spayed and neutered rabbits.   </p>
           <p>BWF was featured multiple times in LA Times, Huffington Post, LA Business Journal, KABC, CBS, and NBC’s <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/rescued-from-illegal-animal-traffickers-in-los-angeles-fashion-district-bunny-ready-adopted/1943752/">Eight-piece Investigation</a> . BWF voice was heard on KSWD/100.3FM The Sound, 89.3 KPCC, and 102.7 KIIS FM/570 KLAC AM/98.7 KYSR FM. Santee Alley Baby Bunnies *WON* the <a href="#">Genesis Award</a> at the Humane Society of the United States and the Emmy Award at the <a href="https://www.emmys.com/content/65th-los-angeles-area-emmy-awards-nominations-winners">65th LA Area Emmy Awards Nominations & Winners</a>. In 2016 BWF was featured on ABC7 in FABlife episode promoting “Bunnies & Tragedy of Easter,” The Show & Tell Show with Caroline Elliott, and “Vegans in Music.”</p>
           <p>BWF track record of effectiveness has led to meaningful victories for animals in city legislatures.  BWF received the recognition by The County of LA (Michael D. Antonovich), The California State Assembly (Cameron M. Smyth), and The City of Santa Clarita (Frank Ferry, Mayor).</p>
          </div>
        <div class="grid-item4">
           <h4>Recent Public Outreach & Education:</h4>
           <p>In 2016, BWF Volunteers pulled off TEN events during Easter including Kidspace Children's Museum in Pasadena, Western University of Health Sciences College in Pomona, Arts for Animal's Sake in Silverlake, Bunnymania in Wilding Crane Gallery and Chung King Studio (The National Museum of Animals) in Los Angeles. In addition, BWF representatives visited California Wildlife Center, attended the First Eagle Rock Animal Fest, the HSUS Gala, and participated in The National Animal Rights Day (NARD). BWF organized 50+ Adoption events, including the Bunny Brushing Fest at Petco Pasadena. In Oct-Nov, BWF Volunteers showed up at the Bridges Academy Community Service Fair in Studio City, Montebello Pet Fair in Montebello, Kidspace in Pasadena (again), Temple Aliyah’s Mitzvah Day Fair, Tofurky Trot 5K at the Rose Bowl Stadium organized by National Museum of Animals & Society.</p>
           <h4>Excerpts/Prior Achievements:</h4>
           <p><strong>Illegal Animal Sales in Santee Alley</strong>: Santee Alley, LA Fashion District, was the city's number one haven for illegal animal sales where underaged rabbits, kittens, salmonella infected turtles, parvo-infected puppies, and exotic birds were sold illegally on a daily basis. Animals were kept in filthy conditions in the glaring sun with no food or water, and many were sick or dying when sold.  These activities clearly violated City codes and other statutes as well.  BWF worked tediously on advocacy efforts to urge the city officials and councilmembers to enforce laws prohibiting illegal sales of animals; to better protect the health and welfare of animals and humans that are victimized by such sales; and, where necessary and appropriate, propose new legislation and ordinances in support of these efforts.</p>
           <p>BWF successfully combatted illegal animal traffickers in Santee Alley by collaborating with the City Attorney’s Office, and by aiding in the arrest of notorious ring leaders behind this crime. BWF volunteers followed the traffickers, and provided LAPD with the evidence of their offenses. As a result, the bail amount increased from the mere $25 to $26,000, the infamous ring leader of illegal animal traffickers, Juan Mena, got arrested and the People vs Juan Mena and Norma Pluma trial began. In December 2013, the traffickers were found GUILTY by the Jury and were sentenced to jail. This marked the beginning of the end of the ongoing practice of animal abuse, cruelty and disregard for the animal protection laws in Santee Alley, LA Fashion District.  Our documentary "The Deadly Secret of Santee Alley" is under way with the collaborative effort of USC Cinema & TV School volunteer filmmakers. In 2011, our documentary was a finalist at MY HERO Int'l Film Festival in the Independent Features in Development Category.</p>
           <p><strong>Avitrol Saga</strong>: Our investigative division has worked on several projects including capturing the immense suffering of birds caused by the ingestion of Avitrol, increasing awareness of the danger and cruelty of the use of this chemical.</p>
           <p><strong>Ordinance Banning Pet Stores from Selling Rabbits</strong>: In 2013, BWF was instrumental in pushing the LA City Council to adopt an ordinance banning pet stores from selling rabbits from commercial breeders and limiting pet stores to selling animals obtained from shelters, humane societies and registered rescue groups. </p>
           <p><strong>‘Bunnies for Puppies & Kitties’ Division</strong>: BWF formed “Bunnies for Puppies & Kitties” division that, through a collaborative effort with other solely cat/dog rescues, saved lives of over 500 dogs/cats from high-kill LA County & City shelters.</p>
           <p><strong>Investigations of Illegal Rabbit Breeding Operations</strong>: In 2014, BWF conducted several undercover investigations of illegal rabbit breeding operations in the City of LA that resulted in the discussion with the City Officials to bring about “(Shelter) Equity and Rabbit Equality”.   At the time many of the city ordinances, particularly those governing breeders, did not apply to the breeding or keeping of rabbits.  BWF presented various rabbit breeding cases before the LAAS Board of Commissioners and educated the public officials about much needed regulations and legislative changes in regards to keeping rabbits as pets.  In 2015 -2016 BWF continued to work with LAAS Board of Commissioners & PAWS to bring about more city ordinances related to protection of rabbits.</p>
           <p><strong>Advocacy Work: Shelter Equity and Rabbit Equality</strong>:  The uphill battle to amend the existing city ordinances that protect cats and dogs by adding/including the rabbits as beneficiaries to those laws is still very much alive.  However, a significant progress was made. BWF requested the amendment of the existing city ordinances that protect cats and dogs, by addition/inclusion of the rabbits as beneficiaries to those laws.</p>
           <p><strong>Notes</strong>: BWF President brought up issues of 1) Increasing volume of LAAS rabbits pulled by BWF 2) medical issues related to WRONG food (pellets for lab rabbits!) fed to LAAS rabbits 3) Lack of SAFE spay/neuter low-cost vets where recently voted vouchers can be used 4) requested a report that will track bunnies including those who have been euthanized 5) requested more data for the rabbits; where they have been placed; desired list for spay/neuter vets for bunnies available for partners and new bunny owners 6) recounted botched spay/neuter surgeries performed on rabbits and suggested other animal hospitals willing to work LAAS for an increased reimbursement.</p>

           <h2>Our Story</h2>
           <h3>BWF shares LA's Deadly Secret of Santee Alley</h3>
           <p><em>UNWEANED BABY BUNNIES, taken from their mothers and sold in Santee Alley are 10 – 14 DAY OLD. They should stay with their mothers a minimum of 8 weeks. They can ONLY survive on MILK.  Most DIE within 2-5 days of purchase. They are NOT MINIATURE OR DWARF bunnies as claimed by the ILLEGAL profit-hungry vendors.  DO NOT BUY THESE BUNNIES!</em></p>
           <p>Take a walk down Santee Alley, the garment district of downtown Los Angeles, and you will unveil horrors of the seemingly innocent animal trade. "They" are breeding them under the worst possible conditions, and discarding their mothers after they are unable to "produce" any more. Snake food? Bulldog training? Gift for a laboratory testing? Food? We don't know, but what we do know is that the babies are supposed to stay with their mothers for at least 8 weeks. Instead, "They" snatch them when they are 8 - 10 days old, eyes closed, chances of survival minimal, and sell them in Santee Alley for a pittance as "pets." "They" feed the babies lettuce and carrots which gives them diarrhea and, after hours of seizures, causes a slow and painful death. During the summer, babies are put in miserable bird cages, dehydrated, starved and kept in filthy conditions. During the winter, they freeze and die before they even reach the shelter. These babies are being sold as pets for children. Those who buy them typically end up with a dead bunny the next day.</p>
           <p>At times, the LAPD impound the animals, chase "Them" away and call animal control to pick them up. Since "They" are not penalized, "They" come back the next day and it's the same atrocity all over again. The LA Fashion BID (Business Improvement District) trucks come and pick up the animals (bunnies, birds, turtles, etc.) take them to their field office, and keep them there for LA Animal Control to pick up. In the past, once the animals were taken to "safety" at the North LA Animal shelter, they were euthanized the very same day they were "rescued." However, since June 15th, 2008, BTW has been in the trenches with LA Fashion BID staff fighting against this problem. Not only have we brought the attention of the authorities to this illegal and cruel activity, but we have also begun rescuing these bunnies so that they are not sent to a certain death through LA Animal Control. Once rescued, we pick them up, de-worm them, de-flea them, give them medicine and wean them for two months until they are strong enough to live on hay, veggies and pellets. Then we look for good homes where they can live happy and safe.</p>
           <p>While the LAPD consider this atrocious act a simple misdemeanor, we think of it as animal cruelty. Not only is this an issue of animal cruelty, but it is an issue of public health and safety. The CDC warns against catching salmonella from turtles that can also spread other diseases, such as TB, chlamydiosis, arizonosis, and colibacillosis. The sale of turtles smaller than 4 inches has been banned since 1975; but this doesn't stop "Them" from selling those babies. IT IS A HEALTH ISSUE, AN ANIMAL CRUELTY ISSUE, A TAXPAYER ISSUE.</p>
           <p>Common sense tells us that this "revelation" would bring about a concerted effort by the city and County, but the LAPD claim that they are unable to stop this cruelty. Our emails with the City of LA are answered but not acted upon. They tell us how difficult it is to increase the fines, how difficult it is to stop the vendors, how difficult it is to change the law and how difficult it is to consider this act of animal cruelty a crime — not misdemeanor. We have written to the District Attorney's Office, the Mayor's Office and the Governor, but we were ignored! We even risked our lives to take photos of the criminals and supply them to LAPD. Fifty photos and a video have been supplied to the LAPD but they still haven't processed a police report, let alone prosecute these vendors.</p>
           <p>In June of 2008, our Founder, Lejla Hadzimuratovic, <a href="#">almost lost her life by confronting these vendors</a>... but no one cared. Even PETA, which originally sent her there as a volunteer, washed their hands of this case, and advised her that these animals should be euthanized and that they were "sorry" that she was attacked. Los Angeles Downtown News published a story by Anna Scott, who ironically captured the very same vendors' faces on her camera who were still standing on the very same corner and selling more bunnies, salmonella-infected turtles and little birds.</p>

                <h3>Lejla Hadzimuratovic</h3>
               <p>Founding Board Member, Founder & President, with focus on Advocacy & Legislation, Volunteer since 2008.</p>    
               <p>In 2008, Lejla founded BWF, a non-profit 501 (c) 3, with a focus on eradicating illegal animal sales downtown Los Angeles. She has devoted herself to the rescue of un-weaned baby rabbits from Santee Alley and has saved and personally housed over 4000 of them. Inquisitive, indefatigable, and Vegan since the age of 17, she has vowed to do her part in changing people’s perception to the planet’s voiceless inhabitants. Lejla’s genuine passion to share a powerful message of “The Deadly Secret of Santee Alley,” compounded with the urgency to raise awareness of animal cruelty was one single asset that surmounted all obstacles and shut down this illegal trade in the heart of LA Fashion District.  She singlehandedly ensured that several legislations protecting rabbits have been voted in this great city of LA. Her relationships with media, city officials, vets, various experts, entertainment industry, and the corporate world continue to keep BWF alive and thriving. Her business acumen holds the Volunteers- Fosters - Mentors together, and her artistic sensitivity along with a unique and compelling way of storytelling on Social Media (She runs the 400K FB page and 5 BWF Volunteer Groups on FB) raises awareness of rabbit education, consequences of pet overpopulation, animal cruelty and the illegal animal sales across a wide range of audiences and demographics. Lejla is indispensable part of the BFW’s success.  Her wish is for BWF to be self-sustained and structured as one of the thriving leaders in the non-profit, animal advocacy and animal rights movement arena.</p> 
               <p>Lejla has experienced injustice firsthand, has lived and traveled all over the world, and had the exposure to some of the most extreme human living situations (Bosnia, Iraq).  Perhaps it is that ultimate connection with human suffering that caused her to have an intense connection with the voiceless animal victims, especially with the often-overlooked and misunderstood rabbits, and even more extreme – un-weaned baby bunnies taken from their mothers too young to survive. Her activist and artistic voice shapes the global scope of the BWF story, the story she lived & continues to live every day.</p> 
               <p>Lejla holds a master’s degree in Communications Management, M.B.A in Entertainment Industry Financing and is an alumna of the Annenberg School for Communication, Marshall School of Business, and School of Cinema and Television at the University of Southern California (USC).  Fluent in ten languages, she also holds a bachelor’s degree in modern languages (English, French, and Spanish) and yet another master’s degree in Classical Arabic.</p>

               <p>Co-Founder, Secretary & Treasurer, Social Media Point of Contact, Events Planner, Volunteer since 2008.</p>  
               <p>Valida runs BWF’s social media (Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube).  She edits short videos featuring adoptions, special needs buns, and investigations.  She’s an active Rabbit Advocate. Originally from Sarajevo, Valida fled a heavily conflicted Bosnia to pursue higher education in the US. She received a BA in World Arts and Cultures from UCLA, and then a master’s degree in Dance and Video Production, also from UCLA. In 1998, while still in the undergraduate program, Valida won the prestigious President’s Fellow Grant that funded her debut documentary short, Youth of Sarajevo, After the Aftermath. The 23-minute documentary offers a glimpse into the lives of six young Bosnians, all struggling to make sense of the new post-war reality. The making of the film further solidified her love of documentary film and set the course for the next few years. Winning a coveted nationwide Pew Charitable Trusts Fellowship in 2000 followed with the release of her feature-length documentary, Concentric Beats. The film was featured at the Miami Winter Music Conference and at the Sarajevo Film Festival in 2001. Valida spent time working on various shorts, including Come Come, a film about Sufi practice in Bosnia; Shakespeare in Baghdad, a personal account of Valida’s childhood in Baghdad and the US-led Iraq invasion; and Saving The World, One Bunny At a Time, about a Los Angeles based animal rights advocacy group (BWF). Valida is also one of Los Angeles’ premier music voices, having been a DJ for over 15 years, she can be heard on air on KCRW (89.9 FM) in Los Angeles on Mondays from 12 to 3 am as part of their program The Lab.</p>

           <h2>The Deadly Secret of Santee Alley</h2>
           <p><em>The Deadly Secret of Santee Alley" is a film about the efforts of Bunny World Foundation to unveil the horrors of illegal animal trade at Santee Alley and raise awareness of animal cruelty Downtown Los Angeles.</em></p>
           <p>Take a walk down Santee Alley, the garment district of downtown Los Angeles, and you will unveil horrors of the seemingly innocent animal trade. "They" are breeding them under the worst possible conditions, and discarding their mothers after they are unable to "produce" any more. Snake food? Bulldog training? Gift for a laboratory testing? Food? We don't know, but what we do know is that the babies are supposed to stay with their mothers for at least 8 weeks. Instead, "They" snatch them when they are 8 - 10 days old, eyes closed, chances of survival minimal, and sell them in Santee Alley for a pittance as "pets." "They" feed the babies lettuce and carrots which gives them diarrhea and, after hours of seizures, causes a slow and painful death. During the summer, babies are put in miserable bird cages, dehydrated, starved and kept in filthy conditions. During the winter, they freeze and die before they even reach the shelter. These babies are being sold as pets for children. Those who buy them typically end up with a dead bunny the next day.</p>
           <p>At times, the LAPD impound the animals, chase "Them" away and call animal control to pick them up. Since "They" are not penalized, "They" come back the next day and it's the same atrocity all over again. The LA Fashion BID (Business Improvement District) trucks come and pick up the animals (bunnies, birds, turtles, etc.) take them to their field office, and keep them there for LA Animal Control to pick up. In the past, once the animals were taken to "safety" at the North LA Animal shelter, they were euthanized the very same day they were "rescued." However, since June 15th, 2008, BTW has been in the trenches with LA Fashion BID staff fighting against this problem. Not only have we brought the attention of the authorities to this illegal and cruel activity, but we have also begun rescuing these bunnies so that they are not sent to a certain death through LA Animal Control. Once rescued, we pick them up, de-worm them, de-flea them, give them medicine and wean them for two months until they are strong enough to live on hay, veggies and pellets. Then we look for good homes where they can live happy and safe.</p>
           <p>While the City consider this atrocious act a simple misdemeanor, we think of it as animal cruelty. Not only is this an issue of animal cruelty, but it is an issue of public health and safety. The CDC warns against catching salmonella from turtles that can also spread other diseases, such as TB, chlamydiosis, arizonosis, and colibacillosis. The sale of turtles smaller than 4 inches has been banned since 1975; but this doesn't stop "Them" from selling those babies. IT IS A HEALTH ISSUE, A CHILD LABOR ISSUE, A GANG ISSUE, AN IMMIGRATION ISSUES, AN ANIMAL CRUELTY ISSUE, A TAXPAYER ISSUE.</p>
           <p>Common sense tells us that this "revelation" would bring about a concerted effort by the city and County, but the LAPD claim that they are unable to stop this cruelty. Our emails with the City of LA are answered but not acted upon. At first, they told us how difficult it was to increase the fines, how difficult it was to stop the vendors, how difficult it was to change the law and how difficult it was to consider this act of animal cruelty a crime — not misdemeanor. We have written to the District Attorney's Office, the Mayor's Office and the Governor, but we were ignored! We even risked our lives to take photos of the criminals and supply them to LAPD. Fifty photos and a video have been supplied to the LAPD but they still haven't processed a police report, let alone prosecute these vendors.  Now, THREE YEARS LATER, something is finally being done...</p>
           <p>In June of 2008, our Founder, Lejla Hadzimuratovic, almost lost her life by confronting these vendors... but no one cared. Even PETA, which originally sent her there as a volunteer, washed their hands of this case, and advised her that these animals should be euthanized and that they were "sorry" that she was attacked. Los Angeles Downtown News published a story by Anna Scott, who ironically captured the very same vendors' faces on her camera who were still standing on the very same corner and selling more bunnies, salmonella-infected turtles and little birds.</p>
